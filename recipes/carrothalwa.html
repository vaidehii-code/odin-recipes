            <h3>Tips to Make Gulab Jamun</h3> 
        
           <p> Allow the dough to rest before shaping to ensure softer Gulab jamun.
            Divide dough equally and shape smooth, crack-free balls with gentle handling, avoiding kneading or excessive pressure.
            Make small dough balls since they expand while frying and soaking in syrup.
            Test the oil with a small piece of dough; it should rise slowly without turning dark immediately.
            Fry Gulab Jamuns on a gentle flame to cook evenly without browning outside too quickly.
            Let fried Gulab Jamuns cool a bit before adding to warm syrup to avoid shrinking.
            Garnish with chopped nuts or edible silver leaf for extra flavour and elegance.
            As mentioned in the above Gulab Jamun recipe, serve the sweet warm or at room temperature for the best taste and texture.
