        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 8 cups shredded carrots</li>
            <li> 8 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>24 green cardamom pods or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
            <li>1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry- roasted pistachio nuts</li>
            
          </ul>
          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Combine carrots, milk, and sugar in a 6- to 8-qt. Dutch oven; bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin to break open cardamom pods. Coarsely crush seeds, discarding the shells. (If using ground cardamom, skip this step.) </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook half of cardamom until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrot mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and jammy, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>Stir in remaining cardamom. Sprinkle with almonds and pistachios just before serving. (Chill in an airtight container up to 5 days; freeze up to 3 months.) </li>
